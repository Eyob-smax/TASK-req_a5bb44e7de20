1. Fix Check Verdict
- Overall: Fully Fixed
- Summary:
  - Fixed: 5
  - Partially Fixed: 0
  - Not Fixed: 0

1.1 Changes Confirmed as Fixed
- Billing schedule update now enforces policy authorization before write.
- Grade-item list endpoint now enforces section-aware authorization.

2. Scope and Method
- Static re-check of the exact issues listed in .tmp/audit_report-2.md.
- Targeted runtime validation performed in Docker to confirm the security fixes behave as expected.
- Executed (docker compose backend container):
  - repo/backend/api_tests/Domain/Coverage/EndpointGapClosureTest.php
  - repo/backend/api_tests/Domain/Roster/ImportTest.php
  - repo/backend/api_tests/Domain/GradeItems/CrudAndPublishTest.php
- Additionally executed full backend suites:
  - repo/backend/api_tests (all)
  - repo/backend/unit_tests (all)
- Conclusions are based on current code, test artifacts, and the test runs listed above.

3. Issue-by-Issue Fix Check

3.1 High: Missing object-level authorization on billing schedule update
- Previous finding: Any authenticated user could patch any bill schedule by ID.
- Current status: Fixed
- Evidence:
  - Authorization now enforced in controller before update: repo/backend/app/Http/Controllers/Api/BillingScheduleController.php:32
  - BillSchedule policy exists and is registered: repo/backend/app/Policies/BillSchedulePolicy.php:13, repo/backend/app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php:172
  - Negative API test now checks outsider receives 403: repo/backend/api_tests/Domain/Coverage/EndpointGapClosureTest.php:228
- Notes:
  - Authorization model now restricts updates to owner or finance staff via policy logic: repo/backend/app/Policies/BillSchedulePolicy.php:31

3.2 High: Missing authorization on grade-item list endpoint
- Previous finding: Grade-item list could be fetched without explicit authorization.
- Current status: Fixed
- Evidence:
  - Controller now authorizes index access: repo/backend/app/Http/Controllers/Api/GradeItemController.php:25
  - GradeItem policy now has section-aware viewAny rule with enrollment/scope checks: repo/backend/app/Policies/GradeItemPolicy.php:23
  - Negative API test now checks outsider receives 403: repo/backend/api_tests/Domain/Coverage/EndpointGapClosureTest.php:330
- Notes:
  - This closes the prior direct controller gap.

3.3 Medium: Prompt-mandated policy checks on every request not consistently applied
- Previous finding: Inconsistent explicit policy use across authenticated endpoints.
- Current status: Fixed
- Evidence:
  - Dashboard endpoint now has explicit authorization: repo/backend/app/Http/Controllers/Api/DashboardController.php:22 (backed by Gate definition at repo/backend/app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php:166)
  - Mentions endpoint now has explicit authorization and policy wiring: repo/backend/app/Http/Controllers/Api/MentionController.php:17, repo/backend/app/Policies/MentionPolicy.php:20, repo/backend/app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php:183
  - Notification controller explicit authorization remains in place: repo/backend/app/Http/Controllers/Api/NotificationController.php:22, repo/backend/app/Http/Controllers/Api/NotificationController.php:55
- Residual risk:
  - No material residual risk identified within static review scope for this finding.

3.4 Medium: Password minimum-length rule not demonstrably enforced in request flows
- Previous finding: PasswordRule existed but was not clearly enforced at input boundaries.
- Current status: Fixed
- Evidence:
  - New enforcement in roster import-generated passwords using PasswordRule: repo/backend/app/Services/RosterImportService.php:139, repo/backend/app/Services/RosterImportService.php:173
  - Rule remains configured/DI-wired: repo/backend/app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php:83
- Residual risk:
  - No material residual risk identified within static review scope for this finding.

3.5 Medium: Security-critical coverage gaps in tests
- Previous finding: Tests did not catch schedule-update and grade-item list authorization defects.
- Current status: Fixed
- Evidence:
  - Billing schedule gap addressed with outsider 403 assertion: repo/backend/api_tests/Domain/Coverage/EndpointGapClosureTest.php:228
  - Grade-item list gap addressed with outsider 403 assertion: repo/backend/api_tests/Domain/Coverage/EndpointGapClosureTest.php:330
- Residual risk:
  - No material residual risk identified within static review scope for this finding.

4. Consolidated Conclusion
- Fixed items:
  - Billing schedule update authorization gap.
  - Grade-item list authorization gap in controller/policy wiring.
  - Policy-check consistency across authenticated endpoints in the reviewed scope.
  - Password minimum-length enforcement evidence across reviewed password-setting boundaries.
  - Security test coverage updates for originally reported authorization concerns.
- Partially fixed items:
  - None.
- Not fixed items:
  - None from the five tracked findings are fully unchanged.

5. Recommended Minimal Follow-ups
- None required for Audit Report 2 tracked items in this fix-check version.
